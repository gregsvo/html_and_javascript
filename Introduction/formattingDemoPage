        <!--Bold and Strong -->
            <h2><strong>Bold and Strong</h2></strong>
            <p><b>This is bold text.</b>
            <p>The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text as more important.

            <h2>Italic and Emphasis</h2>
            <i>This text is in italics</i>
            <p>The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag also marks the enclosed text as more important.
            <p><em>This is what emphasized text looks like.</em>
        
        <!--Subscript and Superscript -->
            <h2>Subscript and Superscript</h2>
            <p>Subscript text looks like this: <sub>This is subscript</sub>

        <!--Inserted and Deleted -->
            <h2>Inserted and Deleted</h2>

        <!--Marked -->
            <h2>Marked</h2>

        <!--Blockquote -->
            <h2>Blockquote</h2>
